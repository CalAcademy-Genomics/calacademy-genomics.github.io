# BuffCalc V0.03
This tool is designed to facilitate making buffer solutions with several different ingredients. 

{: .caution }
**Consult with CCG staff before using any resource with which you are unfamiliar.** These resources are provided for convenience and reference only; ensure that you understand all calculations and workflows before implementing them into your project, and always independently verify formulas, calculations, and results.

## Instructions for Use

### Step 1: Make a copy
Make your own copy of this sheet by clicking File → Make a Copy.
Be sure to give it a more helpful name than "Copy of BuffCalc V0.03." You may find it helpful to make a copy for each commonly used buffer in your lab.

### Step 2: Enter your buffer name (optional) and target volume.
Currently, target volume must be expressed in mL; we may add L at a later date. If a buffer name is added, it will be included in the "Recipe" section.

### Step 3: Enter your reagent information. 
Not all values are required for each reagent. Required values are in the table below; other values can be entered, but will not affect calculations.

| Reagent Type            | Required Info                                           |
|:------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| Pure solid              | Molecular weight, target concentration/units            |
| Solutions (Molar)       | Reagent concentration/units; target concentration/units |
| Solutions (proprietary) | Target concentration/units (i.e., % v/v)                |
| Pure liquids            | Molecular weight; density; target concentration/units   |

### Step 4: Verify results. 
This spreadsheet is in the testing phase. If you notice any issues, pass them on to Richard in the CCG.

### Step 5 (optional): Select and print the results columns. 
You may wish to print only the last cells for bench use. Highlight the "Recipe" section and print (File → Print, Ctrl+P, etc.). In the Google Sheets print menu, select **Print → Selected Cells.**
