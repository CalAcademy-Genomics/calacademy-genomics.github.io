# NEBNext UltraExpress FS DNA Library Prep Kit

The link to the manufacturer protocol can be found [here](https://www.neb.com/en-us/-/media/nebus/files/manuals/manuale3340.pdf?rev=52e04aea130f455080714644760d5cc8&sc_lang=en-us&hash=DF21AD41C7C1BBDF0603FAFC323221F9).

{: .note}
If you are confident in your pipetting skills, NEB protocols can often be scaled down to half, quarter, or even smaller fractions to save resources. Some steps are suitable for "master mixes" to minimize the impact of pipette variability; read the protocol carefully to identify exceptions. The CCG commonly uses half reactions, while reactions below this volume may require tuning.
